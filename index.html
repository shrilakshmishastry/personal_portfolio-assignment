          Along with  all academic  curriculum I am keenly
          interested in building responsive web design
          and react native applications.
          Currently concentrating on building mental model
           and understanding
          core of dart which is a programming language used
          in Flutter.

          It's been four years since I took programming as a hobby.
           Being a self taught developer, each and every day is a
           new challenge but at the end of the day I laid-back with
            satisfaction of solving it.

          I am very grateful to my brother Shrihari,
          who is a role model for me and always a source of
          inspiration .
           He introduced me to programming and laid a
           solid foundation. Whenever I'm caught up in a
            puzzle which I can't figure out,
           I always turn to him who is a kind of GOOGLE for me.

          Because of him I dare to accept projects
           as he will be always backing up me.
           I started with Python and had C++ in my
           curriculum . In the initial days  I was only solving
           problems,but later got introduced  to
           frameworks and started taking up real world problems.

          What ever I learnt and built,
          I didn't know the core or actual
          concepts behind it till it was  in my  curriculum subjects but when it
           was introduced,  I started understanding
            its meaning.My  practical knowledge about curriculum subjects
             helped me a lot for better understanding of  what has been taught in the class.

          Keeping aside a programmer,
          I love to read books of any kind.
           I have a small library at home ,
          mostly filled with kannada and few
           English novels, story books ,
            autobiography etc.I love to read nature related,
             real life experiences and  short stories.

          So according to me, when curriculum
          topics are in practical observation ,
          it gives much more understanding.

          That said, I'm fortunate to be leading a
          life doing what
          I literally love and what does matter to me.
